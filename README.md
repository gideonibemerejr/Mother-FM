V1.0 of the application serves as the MVP and is the first and only open call for users to submit [Mixcloud](https://mixcloud.com) through the [Add Mix](https://motherfm.netlify.com/create-mix) form. Additionally, the MVP provides some simple functionality to view mixes, blog posts, and an archive.
